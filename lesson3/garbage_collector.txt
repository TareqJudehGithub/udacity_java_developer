 Garbage Collection (GC) 

 - A background process called Garbage Collection (GC).
 - GC that checks all instantiated objects, and destroys them if they do not 
  have any referencesâ€”thus freeing up memory, even without any active management 
  on the part of the developer.


 - GC runs as a background task.
 - GC only removes objects that no longer have references to them.
