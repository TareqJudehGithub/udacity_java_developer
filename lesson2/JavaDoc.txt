What is JavaDoc?
 JavaDoc is a documentation generator that produces a searchable HTML document 
 defining the classes and interfaces of an application. This makes it easy for 
 you and other developers to understand the API of an application.

JavaDoc Comments
 The JavaDoc tool reads through Java files and parses certain parts of the code 
 to automatically generate useful documentation. One part of the code that will 
 be picked up by JavaDoc is a JavaDoc comment (or simply doc comment).

JavaDoc comments are typically added:

 - At the top of a class, right before the class name
 - For each method in a class We'll get some practice with this when we start 
   defining classes later in the course.

Syntax
 JavaDoc comments use a simple syntax that supports multi-line HTML format 
 documentation. Here's what the syntax looks like:
    /** documentation */

  And here's an example:

    /** This program HelloWorld produces a standard output
    *  displaying "Hello World"
    * 
    * @author The author of the class
    * @see A reference to another class
    */
