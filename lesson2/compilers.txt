Compilers
 - A programming language can be understood by both humans and compilers.
 - A compiler is a special program that converts a program written in a 
   programming language into a series of machine codes." 
 - A programmer usually writes a program in a programming language and then 
   runs a compiler, which turns the program code files written by the programmer 
   into a single file with machine code â€“ the final (compiled) program.  
   Program in C++  ==> Compiler  ==>  Machine code 
 - A Java compiler doesn't compile all the classes into one machine-code program. 
 - Java complier compiles every class independently  into a special intermediate 
   code (bytecode).
 - The bytecode is compiled into machine code when the program is started.
 - Java virtual machine (JVM)  must be started first when you need to run a 
   bytecode program.
 - JVM will compile the bytecode into machine code before the program is 
   executed.
 - This approach allows programs written in Java to be run on virtually any 
   device: computers, smartphones, ATMs, toasters, or even credit cards!
 - JVM is the reason why all Android programs are also written in Java.
