- Java is case-sensitive.
- in Java, 'functions' are also called 'methods'). A method is part of a class. 
  In other words, a class is divided into methods and methods are divided into 
  commands."

- classes and packages as ways of organizing our code. 
    public class GettingStarted {
    // Anything between the curly braces is inside the class!
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
      }
    }

Access modifiers
- Access modifiers determine how other classes are allowed to access your 
  variables and methods.
- The keyword public is an example of an access modifier. 
- Access modifiers control things like whether the data inside of a class can be 
  accessed only by other code inside of the class or also by code elsewhere in 
  the application.

Types of Access Modifiers
 - Public
  - Public means the class can be accessed from everywhere
 
 - Private
  - Private means only the defining class can access the data.
  - Private access modifier provides security, by not allowing other classes 
    to change the data directly. Instead, they must make changes to the data via 
    the provided methods only inside its respective class.

 - Protected
  - Protected means that access is restricted to the defining class, package, or
    subclass.

 - Default
  - Default means access is restricted to the defining class or the package. 
  -  This can be used when we have classes inside the same package that we may 
     want to expose data and methods too.

  Here's a summary in a table format for your reference:

Access	Inside class/	Inside package/	Outside package by subclass/ Outside package
Private	    Yes	            No	              No	                      No
Default	    Yes	            Yes	              No	                      No
Protected	  Yes	            Yes	              Yes                       No
Public	    Yes	            Yes	              Yes                     	Yes


Access Modifiers on Methods
 - We can also apply access modifiers to methods.

    void methodName()  // The default is no access modifier
    protected void methodName()
    public void methodName()
    private void methodName()
    
Access Modifiers on Variables
 - We can apply access modifiers to variables as well! 

  private int number;
  int number3;  // Default is no access modifier
  protected int number2;
  public int number1;
