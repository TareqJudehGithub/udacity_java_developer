Logical Operators

 AND &&
  AND combines two or more expressions.
    - Returns true if all expressions were true, otherwise it returns false.

  OR  ||
    - AND combines two or more expressions.
    - Returns true if only one of the expressions is true.

 - NOT !
   - Not turns an expression into it's opposite value.
  
 Order of Operations (for Logical Operators)
  - The ! operator will be evaluated first, then &&, and finally ||. 
  - To change the order of operations you can surround expressions in 
    parentheses.
  
  So, the order of operations is:

    1. Parentheses
    2. NOT !
    3. AND &&
    4. OR ||
