Inheritance
 - One class acquires properties and methods from another class.
 - To avoid unnecessary duplications of variables.
 - Super class (the parent class) or also known as the most general class.
 - Subclass (the child) or also known as the more specific.
 - All Subclasses objects will have the methods of the super class.
 - Abstract classes, which cannot be directly instantiated themselves, but 
   that allow us to define the behavior for each of the subclasses.
